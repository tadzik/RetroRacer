RetroRacer
==========

ThroughTheWindow was using just one key (spacebar). RetroRacer uses two, so by definition
it's 100% better!

Drive your fast red car and try not to crash into slow green cars! Oh, joy!

It's also a showcase of a new Steroids iteration, this one featuring proper collision
detection and PNG support (thanks, timotimo!)

You'll need SDL2 and SDL2_image installed, as well as Rakudo Perl 6
(MoarVM recommended for best experience). Run 'perl6 Configure.pl',
'make' and './RetroRacer' to run it.

Kudos! One day I'll learn to draw too :D
